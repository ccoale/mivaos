IN order to provide for ease-of-readability, coders are expected to follow the following conventions.
These will (hopefully) make code easier to read, and make functions to find.
Functions should have each word capitalized, such as MyFunction.
Variable names should have the second and any following words capitalized, such as thisIsMyVariable.
Macros and pre-defined typedefs (such as typedef unsigned char BYTE) should be in all caps.
Comments should come before include guards.
Include guarder defines should be proceeded with two underscores (__), and be in all caps, with an underline separateing the include define and h. For example, __MYHEADER_H.
